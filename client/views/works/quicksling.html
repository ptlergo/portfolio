    <h5>Challenge Statement</h5>
    <p>
      My task was to establish a new style guide using Apple's human centered
      design with client's brand, and to develop an ios app. for the client's
      contractors to effectively make quotes while on site with a potential
      customer.
    </p>
    <img
      class="case-img"
      ng-src="{{ worksCtrl.caseQuicksling.case_images[1] }}"
      alt="case-summary-image"
    />
    <h5>Understanding</h5>
    <p>
      The journey begins by fully understanding the client's business and their
      goals. I evaluated responses from the list of questions I asked the
      client. I researched the company and their customers to get a sense of
      their brand and their values.
    </p>
    <p>
      The average age of contractors are above 30, and thus may not be familiar
      with mobile interfaces. It was imperative that the app be intuitive, and
      familiar. Incorporating familiar patterns with Apple's human design
      guidelines helped to reach desired behaviors.
    </p>
    <h5>Creating Guiding Principles</h5>
    <div>
      <p>
        After understanding the client's brand, the desired behaviors, and users
        I began to establish key principles for the project which are:
      </p>
      <ul class="principles">
        <li>quick</li>
        <li>easy</li>
        <li>intuitive</li>
        <li>efficient</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        These principles will guide my design decisions through the project's
        timeline. these are my 'north star' on the journey of building a useful
        product.
      </p>
    </div>
    <h5>Wireframes and sketches</h5>

    <p>
      I wanted to keep my designs focused on 'efficiency'. Placing myself in the
      user's shoes, as a contractor I quickly want to convey to the home owner,
      my client, what products they need.

    <img
      class="case-img"
      ng-src="{{ worksCtrl.caseQuicksling.case_images[9] }}"
      alt="prototype"
    />
    <h5>Iterations & Prototype</h5>

    <p>
      after the first iterations of prototypes I sought feedback from the stakeholders and made adjustments.
    </p>
    <img
      class="case-img"
      ng-src="{{ worksCtrl.caseQuicksling.case_images[3] }}"
      alt="image of wireframes"

    <img
      class="case-img"
      ng-src="{{ worksCtrl.caseQuicksling.case_images[4] }}"
      alt="image of xd board"
    />
    <img
      class="case-img"
      ng-src="{{ worksCtrl.caseQuicksling.case_images[5] }}"
      alt="image of xd board"
    />

    <h5>Results and Reflection</h5>
    <p>
      The key challenges were accomplished and I became more adverse with the
      Swift, Objective-c languages, XCode, and the MVVM architecture. From a
      design perspective being able to incorporate good practices and understand
      a different design style with apple human centered design improved my
      other works greatly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Currently the app. has at least 4 stars in the app store, thousands of
      downloads, and the client has expressed such gratitude of not only
      accomplishing all features within the scope but going above and behind.
      Their product has improved contractors workflow, provided customers an
      easier path to purchasing, and will be a useful product for a lifetime.
